# Steam-Snooper

This allows you to partially generate a friends list of a someone's private friends list on steam.

You can find the download [here](https://github.com/cisphon/Steam-Snooper/releases)

## Here's a visual example of how it works:

#### Pick a user with a private friends list:
![one](https://github.com/cisphon/Steam-Snooper/blob/master/images/visual_1.jpg)

#### Stumble upon a person with a public friends list:
![two](https://github.com/cisphon/Steam-Snooper/blob/master/images/visual_2.jpg)

### See if that person is in there:
![three](https://github.com/cisphon/Steam-Snooper/blob/master/images/visual_3.jpg)

### I found you -- therefore I found one of your friends.
![four](https://github.com/cisphon/Steam-Snooper/blob/master/images/visual_4.jpg)
