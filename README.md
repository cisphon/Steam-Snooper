# Steam-Snooper

This allows you to partially generate a friends list of a someone's private friends list on steam.

You can find the download [here](https://github.com/cisphon/Steam-Snooper/releases)

## Here's a visual example of how it works:

* Pick a user with a private friends list:
![one] (https://github.com/cisphon/Steam-Snooper/blob/master/images/visual_1.jpg "visual 1")

* Stumble upon a person with a public friends list:

* See if that person is in there:

* I found you -- therefore I found one of your friends.
